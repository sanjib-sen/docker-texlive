[![Docker Stars](http://img.shields.io/docker/stars/sanjibsen/texlive-thin.svg)](http://hub.docker.com/r/sanjibsen/texlive-thin/)

This is a Docker image containing a [`TeX Live`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live) installation with several fonts.
It is an alternative to my significantly bigger, full `Tex Live` installation in docker, namely [texlive-full](http://www.github.com/sanjib-sen/texlive-full).
While the name of this image includes `thin`, it is not a minimal `Tex Live` installation.
It does contain some additional and basic packages (e.g. curl, git) as well as fonts, but nothing as funky as in the other container.
